## Summary
1. Application is bootstrapped with create-react-app.
2. Special input types like phone/email/postal code are not handled due to "text" type input for all of these. 
So, phone number: "1234567890" will not display as "123-456-7890"
3. No advance level CSS or library is used for styling

## Steps to run the project
1. Run "npm install" command in the root folder
2. Run "npm run build" command in root folder
3. Run "npm run serve" command in the root folder

Above steps will serve the production build of the react application
